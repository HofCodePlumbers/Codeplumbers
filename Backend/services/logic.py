[SYSTEM INSTRUCTION]
A user has asked you to analyze this domain: {safe_url}

Your tasks are:
1. Analyze the domain name structure and determine if it appears to impersonate a legitimate organization (e.g., government agency, company, university, or service).
2. Judge if the domain name uses typosquatting, brand impersonation, or misleading patterns to appear trustworthy.
3. Determine from online search results and website content whether the site is linked to known scams or phishing behavior.
4. Say whether it appears to be from an official or trustworthy source — or is pretending to be.
5. Summarize all findings clearly in a short paragraph, including why the site is or is not trustworthy.
